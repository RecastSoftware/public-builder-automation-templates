This Builder action lets you compare the group memberships of two AD users. This action is particularly useful if, for example, you have a new team member and want to compare their group memberships to those of an existing team member.

This tool completes the following steps:

Gets AD group membership for a selected user
Prompts you to enter the AD username that you'd like to compare against the selected user
Shows you group memberships for both users in tabbed results
