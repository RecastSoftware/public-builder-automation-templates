This Builder action automates a common task â€” taking steps when a person leaves an organization to secure their account credentials and prepare the account for retirement. It's easily adaptable to other user-based tasks as well, and is a nice jumping-off point for Recast Builder.

This tool completes the following steps:

Prompts the admin running the tool to input a new password for the account
Resets the password for the account to this password
Disables the account
Moves the account to a new OU
In the Target Input Parameters panel, you must specify a valid OU in your environment as a Constant value. 

Format Example: OU=RecastUsers,DC=demo,DC=recastsoftware,DC=com
